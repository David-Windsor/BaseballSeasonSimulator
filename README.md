# BaseballSeasonSimulator
Senior Capstone for [David Windsor](gtihub.com/David-Windsor) and [Dan Jackson](https://github.com/DanJackson29) of Westminster College, PA. Capstone advisor is [Dr. John P. Bonomo](http://www.westminster.edu/staff/bonomojp/). 

# Purpose
The purpose of this Project is twofold:
- To create a program capable of accurately simulating an entire season of Major League Baseball within a reasonable degree of error.
- To see how much granulartiy is required to get an accurate simulation. Do we only need to compare batting averges? Simulate innings? How much detail is required to accurately predict a baseball game?
